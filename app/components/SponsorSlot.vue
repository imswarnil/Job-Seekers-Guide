/**
 * A slot from sponsor.imswarnil.com — a directly-sold sponsor, not a network.
 *
 * WHY THE IFRAME DIRECTLY, AND NOT THE `<script>` TAG THE PLATFORM HANDS OUT.
 * That loader finds its own tag with `document.currentScript`, which is null
 * whenever a framework injects the script after parse — so in a Nuxt app it
 * would silently render nothing. Rendering the frame ourselves is the same
 * result with none of the guesswork, and it is one element.
 *
 * The height is reserved up front so the rail does not shift when the ad
 * arrives, and the frame is sandboxed: it may run its own scripts and open
 * links, and has no same-origin access to this page.
 *
 * Nothing about the reader is collected — the platform counts a per-day view
 * and nothing else — which is why this is safe to leave on every page.
